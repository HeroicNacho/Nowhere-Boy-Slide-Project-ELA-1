  <h1>Nowhere Boy Slide Project</h1>
  <h6>ELA project on the book <i>Nowhere Boy</i> by Katherine Marsh.</h6>
  <pre>
    “Ahmed looked at the books Max brought him. It was easy enough to follow the Aquaman comic. The pictures helped”
Max was very considerate for Ahmed and brought books that Ahmed could look at because of the pictures.
The main character is a caring and nice character because he did so much for Ahmed and let him stay.
Max was like a refugee shelter, but his role was to help Ahmed who was a refugee.
The protagonist's perspective shifts when he finds Ahmed, “Max stumbled backward. He was about to shout for help when 
the blanket rustled and a man emerged. He was muscular, with thick, dark eyebrows and the shadow of a mustache.”
He starts realizing what's going on with Ahmed and why he was there, he started acting more responsible and more logical.
