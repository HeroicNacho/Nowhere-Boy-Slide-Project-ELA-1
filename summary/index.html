  <h1>Nowhere Boy Slide Project</h1>
  <h6>ELA project on the book <i>Nowhere Boy</i> by Katherine Marsh.</h6>
  <h5>Beginning of the book</h5>
    <p>
      Nowhere boy is a compelling book with two perspectives, Ahmed and Max. <br>
Ahmed is a kind boy who is a refugee and homeless. <br>
Max is a boy who traveled to Brussels because his parents were in search of a "better" place for Max. <br>
Ahmed ends up in Turkey after bombings in Syria (his home) <br>
He gets to the coast of Greece through a boat and in turn lost his dad, his only family as the rest had been killed in a bomb. <br>
He then rides with a smuggler and eventually ends up in Brussels, also losing his phone. <br>
Ahmed happens to live in Max's house and lives in a wine "cellular" <br>
Max is very brave because he finds him and doesn't report him, he also is a nice kid because he didn't discriminate. <br>
    </p>
    <h5>Middle</h5>
    <p >In the middle of the book, Max gives food and helps Ahmed by giving him supplies. <br>
      Farah is a girl who is Muslim and agreed to help with Max's plan. <br>
      Oscar is a boy who bullied Max but eventually became his friend because Max punched him and they
      stopped getting so heated. <br>
      Farah agrees to help Max out by calling as a "mom" of Ahmed and Oscar would make a passport,
      they did this because Ahmed would need a passport to go to school and Max was determined
      to help him. <br>
      Farah does a phone call and Oscar prints the passport. <br>
      They manage to get Ahmed in school, he also gets his own documentation. <br>
    </p>
    <h5>End</h5>
    <p>Several problems arise in the end</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Where will he (Ahmed) go when Max goes?</li>
      <li>What if someone inspects Ahmed</li>
      <li>What if the terrorist situation gets worse?</li>
    </ul>
    <p>In the end, Ahmed flees because the teacher found Ahmed suspicious.
    Max in a attempt to find Ahmed, found a person close to Ahmed and Max found that Ahmed's dad was actually alive. <br>
    Max finds Ahmed in a park and they go on a train to Hungary to find his dad as that was the location given. <br>
    They get to Hungary but the police stop them and they have to get on a refugee service car but Ahmed got taken in. <br>
    Ahmed finds his dad and reunites, better yet they are allowed to go out of the center and get to America (Washington DC) which is where Max lives. <br>
